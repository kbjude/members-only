# README

This is a mini-blog post project worked on using Ruby on rails, it majorly has two components of a blog i.e user and post. It brings out a number of things as shown here; understanding of active directory, a little bit of relationships amongst models, the rails console and the terminal. I used the default database(Sqlite3)
